The code I have written for the GameJam

-AI
The code here is from the enemy.
It is able to find the player and then do one of two things, depending on which one it is.
The shooter stays at a distance from the player and starts shooting at the player.
The melee moves towards the player until it is close enough, the it starts to attack the player.

-Bullets
How the bullet is able to damage an enemy or player.
The melee script is for the melee enemy to remove the bullet it spawned almost instantly.
I could have done it better but since it was for a gamejam I did it like this to save time.

-HAndD :aka Health and Damage
This is used for the player to indicate how much health you have left, as well as being able to die.
It is for both enemy and player.

-Spawner
This enables the enemies to be able to spawn.

-UI
With this I can save and show score and highscore, which get overwritten if the newest score is higher than the previous one.
Also I can change the scene with the other script, or exit the game.
